  This is not a good challenge and you will learn nothing. There is no need to search for obscure format specifiers, the intended way is to use a very widely used specifier

  `{{ nc }}`
provide:
  - chal.tar.gz
sortWeight: 96
flag:
  file: flag.txt
containers:
  fmtstr:
    build: .
    ports:
      - 5000
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
expose:
  fmtstr:
    - target: 5000
      tcp: 32323
      healthContent: 1. printf
